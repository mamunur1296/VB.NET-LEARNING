VB.NET 
=========

Certainly! Let's create two VB.NET assemblies, "StudentLibrary" and "TeachersLibrary," and a VB.NET console application "CommonApp" that uses data from both assemblies. We'll be using Visual Studio Code for this example.

Step 1: Create the "StudentLibrary" Assembly in VB.NET

Create a Folder for Your Project:

Create a new folder for your project. You can do this using the command line or a file explorer.

Open Visual Studio Code:

Navigate to your project folder and open it in Visual Studio Code.

Create the "StudentLibrary" Project:

In the terminal within Visual Studio Code, run the following command to create the "StudentLibrary" project in VB.NET:

bash

dotnet new classlib -n StudentLibrary -lang VB


Define the Student Class:

Inside the "StudentLibrary" folder, you'll find a file named "Class1.vb." Rename it to "Student.vb" and define the Student class as follows:

vb
Copy code
Public Class Student
    Public Property Name As String
    Public Property Age As Integer
End Class
Build the "StudentLibrary" Assembly:

In the terminal, navigate to the "StudentLibrary" folder and build the project:

bash
Copy code
cd StudentLibrary
dotnet build
Step 2: Create the "TeachersLibrary" Assembly in VB.NET

Create the "TeachersLibrary" Project:

In the terminal within Visual Studio Code, run the following command to create the "TeachersLibrary" project in VB.NET:

bash

dotnet new classlib -n TeachersLibrary -lang VB


Define the Teacher Class:

Inside the "TeachersLibrary" folder, you'll find a file named "Class1.vb." Rename it to "Teacher.vb" and define the Teacher class as follows:

vb
Copy code
Public Class Teacher
    Public Property Name As String
    Public Property Subject As String
End Class
Build the "TeachersLibrary" Assembly:

In the terminal, navigate to the "TeachersLibrary" folder and build the project:

bash
Copy code
cd TeachersLibrary
dotnet build
Step 3: Create the "CommonApp" in VB.NET

Create the "CommonApp" Project:

In the terminal within Visual Studio Code, navigate to the root project folder and run the following command to create the "CommonApp" project in VB.NET:

bash


dotnet new console -n CommonApp -lang VB


Reference the "StudentLibrary" and "TeachersLibrary" Assemblies:

In the terminal, navigate to the "CommonApp" folder and add references to both assemblies:

bash
Copy code
cd CommonApp
dotnet add reference ..\StudentLibrary\StudentLibrary.vbproj
dotnet add reference ..\TeachersLibrary\TeachersLibrary.vbproj
These commands reference the project files (.vbproj) instead of DLLs.

Use Classes from Both Assemblies:

In the "CommonApp" project, open the Program.vb file and use classes from both assemblies as follows:

vb
Copy code
Imports StudentLibrary
Imports TeachersLibrary
Module Program
    Sub Main()
        ' Use the Student class from StudentLibrary
        Dim student As New Student With {.Name = "John Doe", .Age = 20}

        ' Use the Teacher class from TeachersLibrary
        Dim teacher As New Teacher With {.Name = "Mrs. Smith", .Subject = "Math"}

        Console.WriteLine($"Student: {student.Name}, Age: {student.Age}")
        Console.WriteLine($"Teacher: {teacher.Name}, Subject: {teacher.Subject}")
    End Sub
End Module
Build and Run the "CommonApp" Project:

In the terminal, within the "CommonApp" folder, build and run the project:

bash
Copy code
dotnet build
dotnet run
This should create two VB.NET assemblies ("StudentLibrary" and "TeachersLibrary") and a VB.NET console application ("CommonApp") that uses data from both assemblies in Visual Studio Code.
